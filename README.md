# 🍅 PomoPulse

A modern, intelligent Pomodoro timer application designed to boost your productivity through focused work sessions and seamless workflow integration.

## 🎯 What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses focused work sessions (traditionally 25 minutes) followed by short breaks to maintain concentration and avoid mental fatigue.

### How It Works:
1. **Focus Session** (25 minutes) - Work on a single task without interruption
2. **Short Break** (5 minutes) - Step away, stretch, or do something different
3. **Long Break** (15-30 minutes) - After 4 focus sessions, take a longer break
4. **Repeat** - Continue the cycle throughout your workday

### Benefits:
- ⚡ **Improved Focus** - Eliminates distractions and mental fatigue
- 🎯 **Better Task Management** - Breaks large tasks into manageable chunks
- 📊 **Enhanced Productivity** - Maintains high energy levels throughout the day
- 🧠 **Reduced Stress** - Regular breaks prevent burnout and overwhelm
